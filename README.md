## Hello there

My name is Aur√©lien Fernandez, I'm currently a student at ALGOSUP as a developer.

I already had the chance to work on various project, here is a small list:

**In school with my colleagues:**
- Multiple mockup application for companies
- Games on Unity, Unreal engine and one from scratch using SFML
- A Pacman-like game with Assembly x86, limiting ourselves to 16 bits only


I am currently working on my own project, [OLAF](https://github.com/aurelienfernandez/ALGOSUP-Moonshot-OLAF/tree/deploy), It is an application from which users can identify diseases from their vegetable with a single image. The deployment is planned for this summer!
